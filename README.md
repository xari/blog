# Personal website un-frameworking

This project is the work-in-progress transformation of my Gatsby site into an un-frameworked Node script that parses Markdown files into HTML pages.
So far it does the basic job of parsing markdown into HTML and generating the pages for each blog post, but I'm still fiddling around with the best way to bundle nested JS modules from each blog entry.

This project was inspired by [bobbynarvy](https://github.com/bobbynarvy), who encouraged me to write more code from scratch.
